  abstract = {In this review, we provide guidance on the construction of climate scenarios for stress tests\textemdash scenarios that represent disruptive climatic events and can be used to assess the impacts of climate and weather risks at the level of detail that is necessary to identify specific adaptation actions or strategies. While there is a wealth of guidance on scenariobased climate adaptation planning, this guidance typically assumes the selection and use of decadal to century-long time segments of downscaled climate model projections, rather than the creation of a customized scenario depicting a specific extreme event. We address this gap by synthesizing a variety of data sources and analytical techniques for constructing climate scenarios for stress tests that are customized to address specific end-users' needs. We then illustrate the development and application of climate scenarios with a case study that explores water sustainability under changing climate in the Truckee and Carson River basins of California and Nevada. Finally, we assess the potential advantages and disadvantages of the different data sources and analytical techniques described to provide guidance on which are best suited for an intended application based on the system of study, the stakeholders involved, and the resources available. Ultimately, this work is intended to provide the building blocks with which scientist-stakeholder teams can produce their own stress test scenarios to explore place-based weather and climate risks.},

  abstract = {Satellite rainfall products are one of the most valuable tools for water resources monitoring in data-scarce re\- gions, due to their low latency and quasi-global range. However, there are still uncertainties associated with rainfall products performance used to estimate hydrologic signatures in several regions, such as Brazil. Here, we investigate the performance of three rainfall products in estimating daily precipitation, daily river discharge, and hydrologic signatures over Brazil: the SM2RAIN-ASCAT and the GPM+SM2RAIN satellite products, and the ERA5 reanalysis product. We used a subset of 520 catchments from the Catchments Attributes for Brazil (CABra) dataset and the hydrologic modeling was carried out using the MISDc hydrologic model. Satellite-based products performed better than ERA5 for most Brazilian biomes in estimating daily precipitation when compared with ground observations used as reference. Daily river discharge was also better modeled with SM2RAIN-ASCAT and GPM+SM2RAIN. Hydrologic modeling presented low values of bias and {$>$}80\% of catchments with KGE {$>$} 0.5 in calibration. Lastly, hydrologic signatures were well estimated by SM2RAIN-ASCAT and GPM+SM2RAIN, and for some biomes (Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Caatinga) they are better predictors than ground-based observations. We showed that there is a significant added value when using SM2RAIN-ASCAT and GPM+SM2RAIN products in tropical catchments, allowing a high-quality continuous water resources monitoring even in data-scarce regions. Besides, our findings pave the way for a better understanding of hydrologic extremes (droughts and floods) using these satellite rainfall products on multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

The issue is tackled herein by generating a large number of representative climate projections using weather generators calibrated with the outputs of regional climate models. A case study was performed on the South Nation River Watershed located in Eastern Ontario, Canada, using climate projections generated by four climate models and forced with medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the future 30-year period (2071\textendash 2100). These raw projections were corrected using two downscaling techniques. Large ensembles of future series were created by perturbing downscaled data with a stochastic weather generator, then used as inputs to a hydrological model that was calibrated using observed data. Risk indices calculated with the simulated streamflow data were converted into probability distributions using Kernel Density Estimations. The results are dimensional joint probability distributions of risk-relevant indices that provide estimates of the likelihood of unwanted events under a given watershed configuration and management policy. The proposed approach offers a more complete vision of the impacts of climate change and opens the door to a more objective assessment of adaptation strategies.},

  abstract = {When studying the impacts of climate change, there is a tendency to select climate data from a small set of arbitrary time periods or climate windows (e.g., spring temperature). However, these arbitrary windows may not encompass the strongest periods of climatic sensitivity and may lead to erroneous biological interpretations. Therefore, there is a need to consider a wider range of climate windows to better predict the impacts of future climate change. We introduce the R package climwin that provides a number of methods to test the effect of different climate windows on a chosen response variable and compare these windows to identify potential climate signals. climwin extracts the relevant data for each possible climate window and uses this data to fit a statistical model, the structure of which is chosen by the user. Models are then compared using an information criteria approach. This allows users to determine how well each window explains variation in the response variable and compare model support between windows. climwin also contains methods to detect type I and II errors, which are often a problem with this type of exploratory analysis. This article presents the statistical framework and technical details behind the climwin package and demonstrates the applicability of the method with a number of worked examples.},

A unified five-step framework and supporting R-package, foreSIGHT (Systems Insights from the Generation of Hydroclimate Time series), are introduced that enable the application of a scenario-neutral climate impact assessment from appropriate time series generation to the analysis of system performance. The software can be applied to compare both current system performance and selected alternative system management or design options and its application is demonstrated for a case study.},

In this study, we combined meteorological and hydrological drought indices with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to predict future dry years during two periods (2035\textendash 2050and 2085\textendash 2100) in a typical Mediterranean watershed in Northern Morocco, namely, Bouregreg watershed. The developed methodology was then used to evaluate drought impact on annual water yields and to identify the most vulnerable sub-basins within the study watershed. Two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of a downscaled global circulation model were used to force the calibrated SWAT model. Results indicated that Bouregreg watershed will experience several dry years with higher frequency especially at the end of current century. Significant decreases of annual water yields were simulated during dry years, ranging from -45.6\% to -76.7\% under RCP4.5, and from -66.7\% to -95.6\% under RCP8.5, compared to baseline. Overall, hydrologic systems in sub-basins under the ocean or high-altitude influence appear to be more resilient to drought. The combination of drought indices and the semi-distributed model offer a comprehensive tool to understand potential future droughts in Bouregreg watershed.},

  abstract = {Dramatic land clearing occurred in Central Queensland of Australia in the 1960s to 1980s, and its impacts on streamflow are of great importance for regional water resources inventory and management. Paired catchment studies at the small scale (around 10-20 ha) have shown conclusively that clearing forests for agriculture has more than doubled the streamflow in the region. Two previous investigations at the large scale (the Comet basin with an area of 16,460 km2) have drawn quite different conclusions about the land clearing effect on streamflow, varying from 40\% increases in streamflow due to land clearing to all the changes in streamflow occurring as a result of climate variability. To further examine the effect of land clearing on streamflow at the large scale in Central Queensland, this study attempts to resolve the discrepancy of the two previous studies by applying the same set of methods (double mass curves, flow duration curves, Budyko framework, Tanh function and conceptual hydrologic model SimHyd) for three distinct periods, namely pre-clearing, transitional and post-clearing periods, and for two neighbouring large basins. The main conclusions of this study are: 1) the effect of land clearing on streamflow of large basins in Central Queensland are unmistakably detectable; 2) the impact of land clearing manifested itself mostly during wetter years or for wetter basins; 3) for a given basin, the greater the extent of land clearing the larger the effect on streamflow; and 4) a lack of consistent conclusions about the land use change effect on streamflow at the large scale for this region and for several other large basins around the world are likely a result of the different methodologies used, different contrasting periods, and the differing effect on streamflow in relation to the underlying climate variability.},

In this study, we combine the strengths of recently developed exploratory modeling frameworks and comparative hydrology to quantify the relationship between watershed's vulnerability and its physio-climatic characteristics. We propose a definition of vulnerability that can be used by a diverse range of water system managers and is useful in the presence of large uncertainties in drivers of environmental change. This definition is related to adverse climate change and land use thresholds that are quantified using a recently developed exploratory modeling approach. In this way, we estimate the vulnerability of 69 watersheds in the United States to climate and land use change. We explore definitions of vulnerability that describe average or extreme flow conditions, as well as others that are relevant from the point of view of instream organisms. In order to understand the dominant controls on vulnerability, we correlate these indices with watershed's characteristics describing its topography, geology, drainage, climate, and land use. We find that mean annual flow is more vulnerable to reductions in precipitation in watersheds with lower average soil permeability, lower baseflow index, lower forest cover, higher topographical wetness index, and vice-versa. Our results also indicate a potential mediation of climate change impacts by regional groundwater systems. By developing such relationships across a large range of watersheds, such information can potentially be used to assess the vulnerability of ungauged watersheds to uncertain environmental change.},

A common assumption in most modeling frameworks is that catchment's hydrologically relevant characteristics, represented via model parameters, remain constant. However, several studies present evidence on the contrary and suggest potential biases in estimates of future streamflow due to this assumption. Regardless, there is a lack of modeling frameworks that account for the possible impact of climate on catchment's characteristics. To change model parameters with climate, we propose a method based on the Whittaker biome plot that relates biome type to the climatic setting of a catchment. We compare estimates of catchment's vulnerability to climate change obtained from fixed and changing parameters. Our analysis spanning 83 catchments across the conterminous United States shows that considering changes in catchment's representative parameters with climate significantly alters the estimated vulnerability to climate change for a majority of catchments.},

  abstract = {Ensemble streamflow predictions (ESP) from a single hydrological model tend to under-sample the variability needed to provide a good representation of streamflow observations. ESPs typically end up being biased and under-dispersed, making them imprecise and less valuable in an operational context. In this study, a proposed methodology based on a multi-hydrological model approach is applied to address these issues. The forecast methodology includes eight lumped hydrological models whose states were updated through data assimilation using an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to provide initial states to the models, allowing them to better sample uncertainty in the hydrometeorological observations and reduce initial condition errors. ESP forecasts are then driven by numerical weather prediction ensemble forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for a nine-day lead-time on five snowmelt-dominated catchments in Quebec, Canada. These eight assimilated individual ESPs are then post-processed using a quantile mapping bias correction method, after which they are combined in a larger ensemble (known as a Grand Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (GESP)) using a multi-model approach. Results indicate that the proposed methodology allowed reducing both forecast biases and under-dispersion problems for all catchments and four periods corresponding to the seasonality of the streamflow. On their own, the data assimilation (DA) and post-processing manipulations allowed shifting the hydrological ensembles to better encompass the observed streamflow. The multi-model approach further improved the forecasts by increasing their reliability. Talagrand diagrams, supported by the KolmogorovSmirnov test for uniformity, as well as the Average Bin Distance to Uniformity (ABDU) and the Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS), were chosen as performance metrics to evaluate the robustness of the methodology. These findings suggest that it is possible to improve hydrological short-term forecast reliability through a multi-model approach in an operational forecasting context.},

Event coincidence analysis allows to formulate and test null hypotheses on the origin of the observed interrelationships including tests based on Poisson processes or, more generally, stochastic point processes with a prescribed inter-event time distribution and other higher-order properties. Applying the framework to country-level observational data yields evidence that flood events have acted as triggers of epidemic outbreaks globally since the 1950s. Facing projected future changes in the statistics of climatic extreme events, statistical techniques such as event coincidence analysis will be relevant for investigating the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on human societies and ecosystems worldwide.},

Using the MODIS standard land cover and LAI products, global LAI climatologies and statistics were obtained for both pure and mixed pixels to evaluate the effects of biome mixture on LAI estimation. Misclassification between crops and shrubs does not generally translate into large LAI errors ({$<$}0.37 or 27.0\%), partly due to their relatively lower LAI values. Biome misclassification generally leads to an LAI overestimation for savanna, but an underestimation for forests. The largest errors caused by misclassification are also found for savanna (0.51), followed by evergreen needleleaf forests (0.44) and broadleaf forests (\textasciitilde 0.31). Comparison with MODIS uncertainty indicators show that biome misclassification is a major factor contributing to LAI uncertainties for savanna, while for forests, the main uncertainties may be introduced by algorithm deficits, especially in summer. The LAI climatologies for pure pixels are recommended for land surface modeling studies. Future studies should focus on improving the biome classification for savanna systems and refinement of the retrieval algorithms for forest biomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Assessing the relationship between the intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) of extreme precipitation is required for the design of water management systems. However, when modeling sub-daily precipitation extremes, there are commonly only short observation time series available. This problem can be overcome by applying the duration-dependent formulation of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution which fits an IDF model with a range of durations simultaneously. The originally proposed duration-dependent GEV model exhibits a power-law-like behavior of the quantiles and takes care of a deviation from this scaling relation (curvature) for sub-hourly durations (Koutsoyiannis et~al.,~1998). We suggest that a more flexible model might be required to model a wide range of durations (1\,min to 5\,d). Therefore, we extend the model with the following two features: (i)~different slopes for different quantiles (multiscaling) and (ii)~the deviation from the power law for large durations (flattening), which is newly introduced in this study. Based on the quantile skill score, we investigate the performance of the resulting flexible model with respect to the benefit of the individual features (curvature, multiscaling, and flattening) with simulated and empirical data. We provide detailed information on the duration and probability ranges for which specific features or a systematic combination of features leads to improvements for stations in a case study area in the Wupper catchment (Germany). Our results show that allowing curvature or multiscaling improves the model only for very short or long durations, respectively, but leads to disadvantages in modeling the other duration ranges. In contrast, allowing flattening on average leads to an improvement for medium durations between 1\,h and 1\,d, without affecting other duration regimes. Overall, the new parametric form offers a flexible and enhanced performance model for consistently describing IDF relations over a wide range of durations, which has not been done before as most existing studies focus on durations longer than 1\,h or day and do not address the deviation from the power law for very long durations (2\textendash 5\,d).},

To verify and better characterize this trend, a thorough statistical analysis is undertaken. The analysis focuses on three aspects of precipitation: amount, frequency, and intensity at 6-hourly time scale and for each calendar month separately. At the NLDAS-2 native resolution of 0.1258 3 0.1258, Kendall's tau and Sen's slope estimators are used to detect and estimate trends and the Pettitt test is used to detect breakpoints. Parallel analyses are conducted on both NARR and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), subdaily precipitation estimates. Widespread breakpoints of field significance at the a 5 0.05 level are detected in the NLDAS-2 frequency and intensity series for all months and 6-h periods that are absent from the analogous NARR and MERRA-2 datasets. These breakpoints are shown to correspond with a July 1996 NLDAS-2 transition away from hourly 28 3 2.58 NOAA/ CPC precipitation estimates to hourly 4-km stage II Doppler radar precipitation estimates in the temporal disaggregation of CPC daily gauge analyses. While NLDAS-2 may provide the most realistic diurnal precipitation cycle overall, users should be aware of this discontinuity and its direct effect on long-term trends in subdaily precipitation and indirect effects on trends in modeled soil moisture, surface temperature, surface energy and water fluxes, snow cover, snow water equivalent, and runoff/streamflow.},

  abstract = {Rainfall-runoff models are often deficient under changing climatic conditions, yet almost no recent studies propose new or improved model structures, instead focusing on model intercomparison, input sensitivity, and/or quantification of uncertainty. This paucity of progress in model development is (in part) due to the difficulty of distinguishing which cases of model failure are truly caused by structural inadequacy. Here we propose a new framework to diagnose the salient cause of poor model performance in changing climate conditions, be it structural inadequacy, poor parameterization, or data errors. The framework can be applied to a single catchment, although larger samples of catchments are helpful to generalize and/or cross-check results. To generate a diagnosis, multiple historic periods with contrasting climate are defined, and the limits of model robustness and flexibility are explored over each period separately and for all periods together. Numerous data-based checks also supplement the results. Using a case study catchment from Australia, improved inference of structural failure and clearer evaluation of model structural improvements are demonstrated. This framework enables future studies to (i) identify cases where poor simulations are due to poor calibration methods or data errors, remediating these cases without recourse to structural changes; and (ii) use the remaining cases to gain greater clarity into what structural changes are needed to improve model performance in changing climate. Plain Language Summary Rainfall runoff models are tools used by hydrologists in climate change assessments to estimate how future streamflow might change in response to a given (often hypothetical) climate scenario. For example, suppose we can assume that rainfall in a particular location is going to reduce by 20\% in the future. Does this mean that streamflow will also reduce by 20\%? Or will it be 10\% less or 40\% less? Although rainfall runoff models are among the best tools available, they are often not very good at answering this question. When tested on historical multiyear droughts, they often perform poorly, and we are unsure why. One problem is that when a model fails in this task, it is difficult to know what went wrong. Perhaps there was a problem with the data, since environmental monitoring is often subject to large errors. Perhaps the problem lay not with the model itself but with the way it was trained, or calibrated, to the data. Lastly, perhaps the model itself\textemdash its mathematical equations\textemdash need to be changed. To improve our estimates, we need a method to test which cause is behind the model failure; otherwise, we might make changes where none are warranted. This paper proposes such a method, in the form of a multistep framework that can isolate the causes of model failures. By ensuring that our attention is focused in the correct direction, this framework will help us to understand and make better estimates of how river flow will be altered by a changing climate.},

Rating curve uncertainty estimates are provided for most (75 \%) of the catchments, and multiple atmospheric datasets are included, offering insights into forcing uncertainty. This dataset allows users globally to freely access catchment data drawn from Australia's unique hydroclimatology, particularly notable for its large interannual variability. Combined with arid catchment data from the CAMELS datasets for the USA and Chile, CAMELS-AUS constitutes an unprecedented resource for the study of arid-zone hydrology.

  abstract = {Rainfall-runoff models based on conceptual ``buckets'' are frequently used in climate change impact studies to provide runoff projections. When these buckets approach empty, the simulated evapotranspiration approaches zero, which places an implicit limit on the soil moisture deficit that can accrue within the model. Such models may cease to properly track the moisture deficit accumulating in reality as dry conditions continue, leading to overestimation of subsequent runoff and possible long-term bias under drying climate. Here, we suggest that model realism may be improved through alternatives which remove the upper limit on simulated soil moisture deficit, such as ``bottomless'' buckets or deficit-based soil moisture accounting. While some existing models incorporate such measures, no study until now has systematically assessed their impact on model realism under drying climate. Here, we alter a common bucket model by changing the soil moisture storage to a deficit ac\- counting system in such a way as to remove the upper limit on simulated soil moisture deficit. Tested on 38 Australian catchments, the altered model is better able to track the decline in soil moisture at the end of seasonal dry periods, which leads to superior performance over varied historic climate, including the 13-year ``Millen\- nium'' drought. However, groundwater and GRACE data reveal long-term trends that are not matched in sim\- ulations, indicating that further changes may be required. Nonetheless, the results suggest that a broader adoption of bottomless buckets and/or deficit accounting within conceptual rainfall runoff models may improve the realism of runoff projections under drying climate.},

Generation of synthetic daily weather data is a common approach to augment limited weather observations. Here a synthetic daily weather generation model (called SYNTOR) is described. SYNTOR fulfills the traditional role of generating alternative weather realizations that have statistical properties similar to those of the parent historical weather it is intended to simulate. In addition, it has the capability to simulate daily weather records for climate change scenarios and storm intensification due to climate change. The various model components are briefly summarized and an application is presented for semi-arid climate conditions in west-central Oklahoma. SYNTOR generated daily weather compared well with observed weather values. Climate change is simulated by adjusting weather generation parameters to reflect the changed mean monthly weather values of climate projections. Storm intensification is approximated by increasing the top 10 percentile of storm distribution by a predefined amount based on previous studies of trends in United States precipitation. Further evaluation of published storm intensification values and associated uncertainties and spatial variability is recommended.},

Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of NSE (and hence MSE), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the NSE (or MSE) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the MSE. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.},

How alteration of these services under ongoing climate change is mediated by vegetation dynamics is not fully understood. Combining independent remote sensing based vegetation information and distributed hydrological modeling, we investigated the impact of climate-induced vegetation dynamics on long-term non-stationary hydrologic behavior in two forested watersheds in the southern Appalachians. We found significant increases in precipitationrunoff deficit (defined as annual precipitation minus annual runoff), equivalent to annual evapotranspiration plus storage changes, over the last three decades. This non-stationary hydrologic behavior was significantly correlated with long-term and interannual changes in growing season length and subsequent vegetation growth. These patterns in vegetation phenology were attributed primarily to minimum temperature regimes, which showed steeper and more consistent increases than temperature maxima. Using a distributed modeling framework, we also found that the long-term non-stationary hydrologic behavior could not be simulated unless full vegetation dynamics, including vegetation phenology and long-term growth, were incorporated into the model. Incorporating seasonal vegetation dynamics also led to the improved simulation in streamflow dynamics, while its effect spread out through the following dormant seasons. Our study indicates that non-stationary hydrologic behavior has been closely mediated by long-term seasonal and structural forest canopy interaction with climate variables rather than directly driven by climatic variables. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding the ecosystem responses to ongoing climate change for predictions of future freshwater regimes.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In the last decade, DEM-based classifiers based on height above nearest drainage (HAND) have been widely used for rapid flood hazard assessment, demonstrating satisfactory performance for inland floods. The main limitation is the high sensitivity of HAND to the topography, which degrades the accuracy of these methods in flat coastal regions. In addition, these methods are mostly used for a given return period and generate static hazard maps for past flood events. To cope with these two limitations, here we modify HAND, propose a composite hydrogeomorphic index, and develop hydrogeomorphic threshold operative curves for rapid real-time flood hazard assessment in coastal areas. We select the Savannah River delta as a test bed, calibrate the proposed hydrogeomorphic index on Hurricane Matthew, and validate the performance of the developed operative curves for Hurricane Irma. The hydrogeomorphic index is proposed as the multiplication of two normalized geomorphic features, HAND and distance to the nearest drainage. The calibration procedure tests different combinations of the weights of these two features and determines the most appropriate index for flood hazard mapping. Reference maps generated by a well-calibrated hydrodynamic model, the Delft3D~FM model, are developed for different water level return periods. For each specific return period, a threshold of the proposed hydrogeomorphic index that provides the maximum fit with the relevant reference map is determined. The collection of hydrogeomorphic thresholds developed for different return periods is used to generate the operative curves. Validation results demonstrate that the total cells misclassified by the proposed hydrogeomorphic threshold operative curves (summation of overprediction and underprediction) are less than 20\,\% of the total area. The satisfactory accuracy of the validation results indicates the high efficiency of our proposed methodology for fast and reliable estimation of hazard areas for an upcoming coastal flood event, which can be beneficial for emergency responders and flood risk managers.},

Current environmental flow assessments tend to assume climate stationarity, so there is an urgent need for robust environmental flow programs that allow adaptation to changing flow regimes due to climate change. Designing and implementing robust environmental flow programs means ensuring environmental objectives are achieved under a range of uncertain, but plausible climate futures. We apply stress testing concepts previously adopted in water supply management to environmental flows at a catchment scale. We do this by exploring vulnerabilities in different river management metrics for current environmental flow arrangements in the Goulburn River, Australia, under non-stationary climatic conditions. Given the limitations of current environmental flows in supporting ecological outcomes under climate change, we tested three different adaptation options individually and in combination. Stress testing adaptation results showed that increasing environmental entitlements yielded the largest benefits in drier climate futures, whereas relaxing river capacity constraints (allowing more targeted delivery of environmental water) offered more benefits for current and wetter climates. Combining both these options led to greater than additive improvements in allocation reliability and reductions in environmental water shortfalls, and these improvements were achieved across a wider range of climatic conditions than possible with either of the individual options. However, adaptation may present additional risks to some ecological outcomes for wetter climates. Ultimately, there was a degree of plausible climate change beyond which none of the adaptation options considered were effective at improving ecological outcomes. This study demonstrates an important step for environmental flow assessments: evaluating the feasibility of environmental outcomes under climate change, and the intervention options that prove most robust under an uncertain future.},

The series are intended for single sites defined nationally across the UK at a 5 km resolution, but can be generated to be representative across small catchments ({$<$}1000 km2). Scenarios can be generated for the control period (1961e1990) based on observed data, as well as for the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP02) scenarios for three time slices (2020s, 2050s and 2080s). Future scenarios are generated by fitting the models to observations which have been perturbed by application of change factors derived from the UKCIP02 mean projected changes in that variable. These change factors are readily updated, as new scenarios become available, and with suitable calibration data the approach could be extended to any geographical region.},

The KnnCAD Version 4 approach is shown to improve on the previous versions of the model and offers a major advantage over many parametric and semiparametric weather generators in that multisite use can be easily achieved without making statistical assumptions dealing with the spatial correlations and probability distributions of each variable.},

Uncertainty estimations are critical for actionable hydrological prediction, and while standardized community benchmarks are becoming an increasingly important part of hydrological model development and research, similar tools for benchmarking uncertainty estimation are lacking. This contribution demonstrates that accurate uncertainty predictions can be obtained with deep learning. We establish an uncertainty estimation benchmarking procedure and present four deep learning baselines. Three baselines are based on mixture density networks, and one is based on Monte Carlo dropout. The results indicate that these approaches constitute strong baselines, especially the former ones. Additionally, we provide a post hoc model analysis to put forward some qualitative understanding of the resulting models. The analysis extends the notion of performance and shows that the model learns nuanced behaviors to account for different situations.},

However, a reliable assessment of the water budget and water yield for the Indian sub-continental river basins has been lacking. We used 0.25{$\smwhtcircle$} gridded meteorological observations and five hydrological models to construct water budget estimates for the Indian sub-continental river basins for the 1951\textendash 2016 period. The hydrological models (i.e. VIC, CLM, Noah-MP, H08, and CWatM) were calibrated against observed streamflow and evaluated for evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture. Considerable uncertainty in the water budget components (ET and total runoff) was found due to the process representation and parameterization of hydrological models. Multi\- model ensemble mean of the five hydrological models performed better than individual models for most basins for water budget components. West coast, Brahmaputra, and Brahmani are the three wettest river basins. At the same time, Sabarmati, Indus, and Pennar are the three driest basins in terms of mean annual precipitation in the Indian sub-continent. The three transboundary river basins (Brahmaputra, Ganga, and Indus) have the highest water yield of 731.9 ({$\pm$}50.2), 582.4 ({$\pm$}89.4), and 231.1({$\pm$}71) km3, respectively. The Budyko framework showed that only two basins (West Coast and the Brahmaputra) over the Indian sub-continent fall under the energylimited (relatively lower atmospheric water demands) conditions. In comparison, the other sixteen river ba\- sins are in water-limited (higher atmospheric water demands) condition. Our findings have implications for water resources planning and management in one of the world's most populated regions.},

However, quantifying the changes in future flood flashiness is challenging due to the lack of high-resolution climate simulations. Here we use outputs from a continental convective-permitting numerical weather model at 4-km and hourly resolution and force a numerical hydrologic model at a continental scale to depict such change. As results indicate, US floods are becoming 7.9\% flashier by the end of the century assuming a high-emissions scenario. The Southwest (+10.5\%) has the greatest increase in flashiness among historical flash flood hot spots, and the central US (+8.6\%) is emerging as a new flash flood hot spot. Additionally, future flash flood-prone frontiers are advancing northwards. This study calls on implementing climate-resilient mitigation measures for emerging flash flood hot spots.},

The light transmittance coefficient (k) was obtained by analyzing vertical leaf and light distribution in the forest canopy. An independent LAI estimate was obtained using litterfall data. The calculated k value was 0.610 {$\pm$}0.035 (standard error). Average maximum LAI obtained with litterfall data was 4.2 + 0.4 m2 m\textasciitilde 2. There was a significant correlation (P{$<$} 0.001, r= 0.98) between litter-LAI estimations and those obtained with the Beer-Lambert equation. The regression explained 95\% of the variation; however, light-LAI overestimated litter-LAI by a constant of 0.87{$\pm$}0.12 m2 m\textasciitilde 2 (the slope was 1.03 and Y intercept was 0.87). The discrepancy is partially attributed to leaf retention of the few evergreen species, and perhaps leaf retention of a few deciduous species beyond the end of the litterfall collection. Maximum annual LAI was similar in both study years (4.5{$\pm$}0.3 m2 m\textasciitilde 2 in 1990 and 4.9{$\pm$}0.4 in 1991). Minimum LAI showed considerable variation between years with similar values in the dry seasons of 1990 and 1991 (1.0 {$\pm$}0.1 m2 and 0.9 + 0.1 m2 mr2, respectively), but much higher values in 1992 (2.7 + 0.2 m2 m\textasciitilde 2). The difference is probably attributed to an atypical rainfall event in January 1992 (644 mm), which retarded leaf abscission.},

These sources of uncertainty are analyzed separately for two future time periods (2036 to 2065 and 2066 to 2095). An uncertainty metric is calculated based on the variation in simulated precipitation due to choice of GCMs, emission scenarios and downscaling models. The results show that the selection of a downscaling method provides the largest amount of uncertainty when compared to the choice of GCM and/or emission scenario. However, the choice of GCM provides a significant amount of uncertainty if downscaling methods are not considered.

While direct runoff is the quick response stemming from surface and shallow subsurface flow paths and is often associated with floods, baseflow represents the groundwater contribution from stored sources (e.g., groundwater) to streams and is crucial for environmental flow regulations, and water supply, among others. L'vovich (1979, https:// doi.org/10.1029/SP013) proposed a two-step water balance partitioning, where precipitation is divided into direct runoff and catchment wetting, followed by the disaggregation of the latter into baseflow and evapotranspiration. Here, we investigate the role of the aridity index (ratio between mean-annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation) in controlling the long-term (mean-annual) fluxes of direct runoff and baseflow. We present an analytical solution beginning with similar assumptions as proposed by Budyko (1974, https://www.elsevier.com/books/climate-and-life/budyko/978-0-12-139450-9), leading to two complementary expressions for the two fluxes. The aridity index explained 77\% and 89\% of variability in direct runoff and baseflow from 378 catchments within the continental United States, while our formulations were able to reproduce the patterns of water balance partitioning proposed by L'vovich (1979, https://doi.org/10.1029/SP013) at the mean-annual timescale. Our approach can be used to further understand how climate and landscape controls the terrestrial water balance at mean-annual timescales, while also representing a step toward the prediction of baseflow and direct runoff at ungauged basins.},

  abstract = {In recent years droughts have been occurring frequently, and their impacts are being aggravated by the rise in water demand and the variability in hydro-meteorological variables due to climate change. As a result, drought hydrology has been receiving much attention. A variety of concepts have been applied to modeling droughts, ranging from simplistic approaches to more complex models. It is important to understand different modeling approaches as well as their advantages and limitations. This paper, supplementing the previous paper (Mishra and Singh, 2010) where different concepts of droughts were highlighted, reviews different methodologies used for drought modeling, which include drought forecasting, probability based modeling, spatio-temporal analysis, use of Global Climate Models (GCMs) for drought scenarios, land data assimilation systems for drought modeling, and drought planning. It is found that there have been significant improvements in modeling droughts over the past three decades. Hybrid models, incorporating large scale climate indices, seem to be promising for long lead-time drought forecasting. Further research is needed to understand the spatio-temporal complexity of droughts under climate change due to changes in spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. Applications of copula based models for multivariate drought characterization seem to be promising for better drought characterization. Research on decision support systems should be advanced for issuing warnings, assessing risk, and taking precautionary measures, and the effective ways for the flow of information from decision makers to users need to be developed. Finally, some remarks are made regarding the future outlook for drought research.},

The package includes a stochastic ordered allocation procedure as well as an implementation of the CLUE-S algorithm.

We consider both intensity and frequency-based extreme indices for precipitation. The analysis is performed over both large-scale domains as well as regional scales (22 Giorgi land regions). We find that precipitation extremes are substantially reduced in geoengineering simulation: the magnitude of change is much smaller than those that occur in a simulation with elevated atmospheric CO2 alone. In the geoengineered climate, though the global mean of the intensity of extreme precipitation events is slightly less than in control climate, substantial changes remain on regional scales. We do not find significant changes in the frequency of precipitation extremes in geoengineering simulation compared to control simulation on global and regional scales. We infer that SRM schemes are likely to reduce precipitation extremes and the associated impacts on a global scale. However, we note that a comprehensive assessment of moral, social, ethical, legal, technological, economic, political and governance issues is required for using SRM methods to counter the impacts of climate change.},

  abstract = {Impacts of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems are imperfectly constrained by ecosystem models and direct observations. Pervasive ecosystem transformations occurred in response to warming and associated climatic changes during the last glacial-to-interglacial transition, which was comparable in magnitude to warming projected for the next century under high-emission scenarios. We reviewed 594 published paleoecological records to examine compositional and structural changes in terrestrial vegetation since the last glacial period and to project the magnitudes of ecosystem transformations under alternative future emission scenarios. Our results indicate that terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to temperature change and suggest that, without major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems worldwide are at risk of major transformation, with accompanying disruption of ecosystem services and impacts on biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Streamflow data are essential for the calibration of continuous rainfall\textendash runoff (RR) models. The quantity and quality of streamflow data can significantly influence parameter calibration and thus model robustness. Most existing sensitivity analysis studies on the role of streamflow data have used continuous periods to calibrate model parameters, with a minimum of one year, though ideally much longer periods are generally advised. However, in practical model applications, streamflow data series available for model calibration may be rather short or non-continuous. This study aims at assessing the sensitivity of continuous RR models to the quantity of information used during model calibration when it is randomly sampled in the observed hydrograph, i.e. using non-continuous calibration periods. This sampling provides less auto-correlated streamflow information for model calibration than continuous records. Two daily RR models with four and six free parameters were tested on a sample of 12 basins in the USA to obtain more general conclusions. The results showed that, in general, 350 calibration days sampled out of a longer data set including dry and wet conditions are sufficient to obtain robust estimates of model parameters. The more parsimonious model requires fewer calibration data to obtain stable and robust parameter values. Stable parameter values prove more difficult to reach in the driest catchments.},

  abstract = {Climate change scenarios with a high spatial and temporal resolution are required in the evaluation of the effects of climate change on agricultural potential and agricultural risk. Such scenarios should reproduce changes in mean weather characteristics as well as incorporate the changes in climate variability indicated by the global climate model (GCM) used. Recent work on the sensitivity of crop models and climatic extremes has clearly demonstrated that changes in variability can have more profound effects on crop yield and on the probability of extreme weather events than simple changes in the mean values. The construction of climate change scenarios based on spatial regression downscaling and on the use of a local stochastic weather generator is described. Regression downscaling translated the coarse resolution GCM grid-box predictions of climate change to site-specific values. These values were then used to perturb the parameters of the stochastic weather generator in order to simulate site-specific daily weather data. This approach permits the incorporation of changes in the mean and variability of climate in a consistent and computationally inexpensive way. The stochastic weather generator used in this study, LARS-WG, has been validated across Europe and has been shown to perform well in the simulation of different weather statistics, including those climatic extremes relevant to agriculture. The importance of downscaling and the incorporation of climate variability are demonstrated at two European sites where climate change scenarios were constructed using the UK Met.

  abstract = {Daily streamflow information is critical for solving various hydrologic problems, though observations of continuous streamflow for model calibration are available at only a small fraction of the world's rivers. One approach to estimate daily streamflow at an ungauged location is to transfer rainfall\textendash runoff model parameters calibrated at a gauged (donor) catchment to an ungauged (receiver) catchment of interest. Central to this approach is the selection of a hydrologically similar donor. No single metric or set of metrics of hydrologic similarity have been demonstrated to consistently select a suitable donor catchment. We design an experiment to diagnose the dominant controls on successful hydrologic model parameter transfer. We calibrate a lumped rainfall\textendash runoff model to 83 stream gauges across the United States. All locations are USGS reference gauges with minimal human influence. Parameter sets from the calibrated models are then transferred to each of the other catchments and the performance of the transferred parameters is assessed. This transfer experiment is carried out both at the scale of the entire US and then for six geographic regions. We use classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to determine the relationship between catchment similarity and performance of transferred parameters. Similarity is defined using physical/climatic catchment characteristics, as well as streamflow response characteristics (signatures such as baseflow index and runoff ratio). Across the entire US, successful parameter transfer is governed by similarity in elevation and climate, and high similarity in streamflow signatures. Controls vary for different geographic regions though. Geology followed by drainage, topography and climate constitute the dominant similarity metrics in forested eastern mountains and plateaus, whereas agricultural land use relates most strongly with successful parameter transfer in the humid plains.},

  abstract = {Large variabilities in spatio-temporal distribution of water and growing demand for water will pose a key challenge to India as it attempts to ensure sufficient water resources for ecosystem and socio-economic services. Impending climate change compounds the difficulty of this task, as it is hard to predict changes in the already complex Indian monsoon. The standard method of obtaining streamflow projections by propagating downscaled general circulation model (GCM) outputs through a hydrologic model calibrated on historical data are likely to be of little value in the presence of large uncertainties in future climate, especially precipitation in the region. Here, we present an overview of a recently developed alternative exploratory modelling framework that provides useful information to decision makers in the face of large uncertainties regarding future climate change. We employ the exploratory modelling framework to quantify catchment vulnerability to climate change irrespective of future changes that may take place. We highlight the application of the exploratory modelling framework over selected catchments across south-central India by quantifying the vulnerability of their long term water availability to climate change. The metrics of vulnerability quantified are the critical thresholds of changes in mean annual precipitation and temperature that leads to severe decrease in long term water availability in a catchment. Finally, the implications of river interlinking on vulnerability of water availability across India and potential ways to quantify vulnerability in the presence of interlinking are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The open-source programming language R has gained a central place in the hydrological sciences over the last decade, driven by the availability of diverse hydro-meteorological data archives and the development of open-source computational tools. The growth of R's usage in hydrology is reflected in the number of newly published hydrological packages, the strengthening of online user communities, and the popularity of training courses and events. In this paper, we explore the benefits and advantages of R's usage in hydrology, such as: the democratization of data science and numerical literacy, the enhancement of reproducible research and open science, the access to statistical tools, the ease of connecting R to and from other languages, and the support provided by a growing community. This paper provides an overview of important packages at every step of the hydrological workflow, from the retrieval of hydro-meteorological data, to spatial analysis and cartography, hydrological modelling, statistics, and the design of static and dynamic visualizations, presentations and documents. We discuss some of the challenges that arise when using R in hydrology and useful tools to overcome them, including the use of hydrological libraries, documentation and vignettes (long-form guides that illustrate how to use packages); the role of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs); and the challenges of Big Data and parallel computing in hydrology. Last, this paper provides a roadmap for R's future within hydrology, with R packages as a driver of progress in the hydrological sciences, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) providing new avenues for data acquisition and provision, enhanced teaching of hydrology in R, and the continued growth of the community via short courses and events.},

  abstract = {The paper intends to review the current status of low-flow hydrology \textemdash{} a discipline which deals with minimum flow in a river during the dry periods of the year. The discussion starts with the analysis of low-flow generating mechanisms operating in natural conditions and the description of anthropogenic factors which directly or indirectly affect low flows. This is followed by the review of existing methods of low-flow estimation from streamflow time-series, which include flow duration curves, frequency analysis of extreme low-flow events and continuous low-flow intervals, baseflow separation and characterisation of streamflow recessions. The paper describes the variety of low-flow characteristics (indices) and their applications. A separate section illustrates the relationships between low-flow characteristics. The paper further focuses on the techniques for low-flow estimation in ungauged river catchments, which include a regional regression approach, graphical representation of low-flow characteristics, construction of regional curves for low-flow prediction and application of time-series simulation methods. The paper presents a summary of recent international low-flow related research initiatives. Specific applications of low-flow data in river ecology studies and environmental flow management as well as the problem of changing minimum river flows as the result of climate variability are also discussed. The review is largely based on the research results reported during the last twenty years. ᭧ 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {To estimate the robustness of hydrologic models under projected future climate change, researchers test transferability between climatically contrasting observed periods. This approach can only assess the performance changes induced by altered precipitation and related environmental dynamics (e.g., greening under wet conditions), since the instrumental record does not contain temperatures or carbon dioxide levels that are similar to future climate change projections. Additionally, there is an inherent assumption that long-term persistence of changes in precipitation will not further impact catchment response. In this study, we undertake a series of virtual catchment experiments using an ecohydrologic model that simulates dynamic vegetation growth, nutrient cycling, and subsurface hydrology. These experiments explore a number of climate change scenarios. We compare simulations based on persistent altered climate states against simulations designed to represent historical periods with the same precipitation but limited time for ecohydrologic adaptation. We find that persistence of precipitation changes as well as increased temperature and elevated carbon dioxide levels can all substantially impact streamflow under drier future conditions. For wetter future scenarios, simulated differences in the flow regime were smaller, but there was still notable divergence in modeled low flows and other hydrologic variables. The results suggest that historical periods with equivalent precipitation statistics cannot necessarily be used as proxies for future climate change when examining catchment runoff response and/or model performance. The current literature likely underestimates the potential for nonstationarity in hydrologic assessments, especially for drier future scenarios. Plain Language Summary Climate change is expected to impact catchment processes in the future, altering hydrologic response. This raises the issue that models and methods developed using past data may not be reliable for simulating future conditions. To understand the extent of this problem, researchers often test models under climatically contrasting past periods. For example, if a model calibrated under wet conditions performs well simulating a dry period with 10\% less annual rainfall, we assume that the same model could reliably simulate a future climate with a 10\% reduction in rainfall. However, future climate change scenarios also have higher temperatures and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and the changes are expected to persist over many decades. Therefore, simulating contrasting past periods may cause less degradation in model performance than simulating future climate change. This study uses a detailed ecohydrologic model to run experiments analogous to a catchment under persistent climate change versus historical variability. We find that persistence of altered conditions, higher temperatures, and increased CO2 levels all influence catchment response substantially, meaning that climatically distinct past periods are not accurate proxies for future climate change. This suggests that testing model performance under past variability will underestimate the risk that climate change poses to hydrologic assessments.},

  abstract = {Impacts of a drought are generally dependent on the severity of the hydrological drought event, which can be expressed by streamflow drought duration or deficit volume. For prediction and the selection of drought sensitive regions, it is crucial to know how streamflow drought severity relates to climate and catchment characteristics. In this study we investigated controls on drought severity based on a comprehensive Austrian dataset consisting of 44 catchments with long time series of hydrometeorological data (on average around 50 year) and information on a large number of physiographic catchment characteristics. Drought analysis was performed with the variable threshold level method and various statistical tools were applied, i.e. bivariate correlation analysis, heatmaps, linear models based on multiple regression, varying slope models, and automatic stepwise regression. Results indicate that streamflow drought duration is primarily controlled by storage, quantified by the Base Flow Index or by a combination of catchment characteristics related to catchment storage and release, e.g. geology and land use. Additionally, the duration of dry spells in precipitation is important for streamflow drought duration. Hydrological drought deficit, however, is governed by average catchment wetness (represented by mean annual precipitation) and elevation (reflecting seasonal storage in the snow pack and glaciers). Our conclusion is that both drought duration and deficit are governed by a combination of climate and catchment control, but not in a similar way. Besides meteorological forcing, storage is important; storage in soils, aquifers, lakes, etc. influences drought duration and seasonal storage in snow and glaciers influences drought deficit. Consequently, the spatial variation of hydrological drought severity is highly dependent on terrestrial hydrological processes.},

The authors found a superior capability of the SPEI and the SPI drought indices, which are calculated on different time scales than the Palmer indices to capture the drought impacts on the aforementioned hydrological, agricultural, and ecological variables. They detected small differences in the comparative performance of the SPI and the SPEI indices, but the SPEI was the drought index that best captured the responses of the assessed variables to drought in summer, the season in which more drought-related impacts are recorded and in which drought monitoring is critical. Hence, the SPEI shows improved capability to identify drought impacts as compared with the SPI. In conclusion, it seems reasonable to recommend the use of the SPEI if the responses of the variables of interest to drought are not known a priori.},

However, most such models require LAI as an input, typically obtained from empirical observations. We tested whether scaling principles based on trade-offs between single leaf and canopy properties could be effectively used to model LAI, thereby obviating the need for empirical observations. To do so, we used the process-oriented model, PnET, configured to estimate LAI from these same scaling principles. We derived biologically based LAI predictions (LAIPnET) for the Harvard Forest (Massachusetts, USA) eddy covariance tower site, a predominately mixed deciduous hardwood forest, using PnET, and compared these with a locally observed phenology record and with LAI estimates from both local (ground-based) photosynthetically active radiation transmittance (LAITRANS) and normalized difference vegetation index satellite data (LAINDVI). We generated the LAIPnET trajectory by running the PnET model with meteorological observations from the flux tower as model drivers. We derived LAITRANS from measurements of above- and below-canopy photosynthetically active radiation at the flux tower, and LAINDVI from observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite-borne sensor of surface greenness for the 1 km2 cell containing the flux tower. Over a 5-year period, LAIPnET and LAITRANS values were comparable intra- and interannually, with maximum values differing by less than 0.1 to 0.2 LAI units (m2 m\textendash 2). Values of LAINDVI were similar to LAIPnET and LAITRANS in midsummer, but higher LAI values were predicted in the early and late portions of the growing season.},

Linear boundaries have been widely used to define the rules. However, urban land use dynamics and many other geographical phenomena are highly complex and require nonlinear boundaries for the rules. In this study, we tested the support vector machines (SVM) as a method for constructing nonlinear transition rules for CA. SVM is good at dealing with nonlinear complex relationships. Its basic idea is to project input vectors to a higher dimensional Hilbert feature space, in which an optimal classifying hyperplane can be constructed through structural risk minimization and margin maximization. The optimal hyperplane is unique and its optimality is global. The proposed SVM-CA model was implemented using Visual Basic, ArcObjectss, and OSU-SVM. A case study simulating the urban development in the Shenzhen City, China demonstrates that the proposed model can achieve high accuracy and overcome some limitations of existing CA models in simulating complex urban systems.},

  abstract = {Drought is a stochastic natural hazard that is instigated by intense and persistent shortage of precipitation. Following an initial meteorological phenomenon, subsequent impacts are realized on agriculture and hydrology. Among the natural hazards, droughts possess certain unique features; in addition to delayed effects, droughts vary by multiple dynamic dimensions including severity and duration, which in addition to causing a pervasive and subjective network of impacts makes them difficult to characterize. In order manage drought, drought characterization is essential enabling both retrospective analyses (e.g., severity versus impacts analysis) and prospective planning (e.g., risk assessment). The adaptation of a simplified method by drought indices has facilitated drought characterization for various users and entities. More than 100 drought indices have so far been proposed, some of which are operationally used to characterize drought using gridded maps at regional and national levels. These indices correspond to different types of drought, including meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological drought. By quantifying severity levels and declaring drought's start and end, drought indices currently aid in a variety of operations including drought early warning and monitoring and contingency planning. Given their variety and ongoing development, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive overview of available drought indices that highlights their difference and examines the trend in their development.

Pour son am\'enagement, la caract\'erisation de la s\'echeresse s'av\`ere essentielle en consid\'erant les analyses r\'etrospectives (p. ex. s\'ev\'erit\'e vs analyse des impacts) aussi bien que la planification prospective (p. ex. \'evaluation des risques). L'adaptation d'une m\'ethode simplifi\'ee par indices de s\'echeresse a facilit\'e la caract\'erisation de la s\'echeresse pour divers utilisateurs et institutions. On a propos\'e jusqu'ici pas moins de 100 indices de s\'echeresse, dont certain utilis\'es de fa\c{c}on op\'erationnelle pour caract\'eriser la s\'echeresse en utilisant des cartes quadrill\'ees aux \'echelles r\'egionales et nationales. Ces indices correspondent \`a diff\'erents types de s\'echeresse, incluant la s\'echeresse hydrologique et la s\'echeresse m\'et\'eorologique agricole. En quantifiant les degr\'es de s\'ev\'erit\'e et en communiquant le d\'ebut et la fin, les indices de s\'echeresse aident actuellement \`a la conduite de diverses op\'erations incluant l'avertissement h\^atif de la s\'echeresse et son suivi, ainsi que la planification des contingences. Compte tenu de leur vari\'et\'e et de leur d\'eveloppement continu, il est essentiel de pr\'esenter une revue compl\`ete des indices de s\'echeresse disponibles mettant en lumi\`ere leurs diff\'erences et d'examiner la tendance de leur d\'eveloppement. Cette publication passe en revue 74 indices de s\'echeresse op\'erationnels ou propos\'es et d\'ecrit les directions de recherche. Mots-cl\'es : s\'echeresse, caract\'erisation de la s\'echeresse, indices de s\'echeresse, s\'echeresse m\'et\'eorologique, indices de v\'eg\'etation.},
